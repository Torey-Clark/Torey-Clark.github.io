    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>
      I work have worked on a variety of things throughout my life from
      highschool until now. Some of my favorite passion projects to date are
      a neural network for translating between Japanese and English, a simple
      page to help track things I want to 3D print, and a collection of
      Rainmeter skins that are really fun to tinker with.

        My collection of work that was done in my translation class. Most
        notable is the solo translation I did for the first chapter of a 
        manga.

        This is where I keep references to my web design assignments when I
        can. We worked a lot with PHP and SQL and I can't really show those
        off since I'm currently using GitHub to host. Maybe one day I'll
        actually pay for a proper host, but I'm cheap.

        Probably one of my top five classes I took. Partly because it is very
        important for my occupation, partly because the professor who teaches 
        it has done a phenomenal job in every class of his that I've taken.

        This is a pretty simple page that I use to track the different models
        I want to print so my bird brain self doesn't forget. I want to 
        replace it with either a page that has server&hyphen;side action or
        with a personal app. I'm currently working on the second but classes
        take a good chunk of my time.

        This project came about a year after I took a course in Artificial
        Intelligence. I don't remember why but I suddenly wanted to create
        a program to translate between Japanese and English. The translations
        it creates are not amazing by any stretch of the imagination. I'm also
        not done with it. Right now, it only translates in one direction. I 
        plan to implement bi&hyphen;directional translations and plug it into
        either a personal app or a webpage with a server. The majority of the
        program is done through Google Colab. If you have any interest in 
        artificial intelligences, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l01c01_introduction_to_colab_and_python.ipynb">check it out</a>. They have tutorials and resources so you can 
        experiment and try out different types of AIs.

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/">Rainmeter</a> is really cool
        program that lets users create a ton of different designs for their
        computer screens that give a new level of customization that
        everyone would love. People make skins for it and upload them so
        anyone can use or improve upon them. Anyone that wants to make their
        own can look at their tutorials which are honestly good. This section
        is a collection of what I have learned while dabbling in Rainmeter and
        what I have made.
