      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>
        This is the landing page for everything me. Collections of games that
        I play, projects that I am working on, the random things I want to
        write about and have easily accessible. This entire site came about
        because I started learning web design and I wanted to practice and
        experiment with everything. It's also quite nice for collecting all of
        my thoughts and work into a single space for my own convenience.
